# PolyChronos Ω v5.0 – An Enterprise-Grade AI Framework for Cursor

**Build exceptional software with a guild of AI savants. PolyChronos Ω is a comprehensive, persona-driven framework designed to bring enterprise-level discipline, planning, and quality assurance to your development workflow within Cursor.**

Welcome to the PolyChronos Ω project scaffold. This repository isn't just a collection of files; it's a complete operating system for software development. By leveraging a **persona-driven**, **phase-aware**, and **context-first** methodology, it transforms Cursor into a coordinated team of AI experts, ready to plan, design, build, and deliver robust software.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   🧠 **Persona-Driven Execution**: Work with a guild of specialized AI personas, from a `Project Manager` to a `Savant Architect`, ensuring expert oversight at every stage.
-   🗂️ **Structured Planning Templates**: A comprehensive set of Markdown templates (`PRD`, `Architecture`, `TestPlan`, etc.) that build a deep, shared context for the AI.
-   ⚙️ **Phase-Gated Workflow**: Progress through the software development lifecycle with explicit quality gates, ensuring no step is missed.
-   ⚖️ **Customizable Quality Rules**: Define your project's standards for code, logging, testing, and security in the `.cursorrules` file.
-   🚀 **Seamless Cursor Integration**: Designed from the ground up to leverage Cursor's unique features, like `@file` context and system prompts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to initialize the PolyChronos Ω framework in your project.

### Prerequisites

-   You have the [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) installed.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project scaffold into your local workspace.
    ```sh
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    ```
2.  **Review the Personas**: Familiarize yourself with the AI team in `/context/personas/`. The `Project Manager (PM)` is your primary orchestrator.
3.  **Complete the Planning Templates**: This is the most critical step. Fill out the templates in `/docs/living/` to build the project's "brain."
    -   `Discovery.md`
    -   `PRD.md`
    -   `Architecture.md`
    -   `TestPlan.md`
    -   `LoggingStrategy.md`
    -   `CodeReviewChecklist.md`
    -   `RefactoringPlan.md` (for existing codebases)
    -   `DecisionLog.md` (maintain this throughout the project)
4.  **Configure Project Rules**: Open `.cursorrules` and adjust any default settings, such as the default persona or code quality thresholds, to fit your needs.
5.  **Set the System Prompt**: In Cursor, set `PolyChronos-Omega.md` as your system prompt. This activates the framework and the `Project Manager` persona, who will use your completed templates to begin orchestration.
6.  **Engage with the PM**: The `PM` will guide you through each development phase. Advance through quality gates using the **👍 `Proceed`** command when prompted.

##  Workflow & Interaction

### The Importance of Templates

Your initial investment in filling out the planning templates pays dividends throughout the project. The quality and detail of your inputs directly determine the effectiveness of the AI.

> **Note:** Each template includes a **"Required Inputs"** section. These fields **must be completed** before the `Project Manager` can effectively initiate the project. If a detail is unknown, state your assumptions or flag it for a research task.

Commit each completed template to your repository. The `PM` will reference them using `@file` to tailor its strategy. Incomplete templates may force the AI to request more discovery steps.

### Interacting with Personas

The `Project Manager` is your primary point of contact. It will delegate tasks to other personas and synthesize their outputs. When any persona requests clarification, provide succinct, factual answers and **update the relevant template document**. This ensures the project's shared context remains accurate.

The workflow is interactive. You are the ultimate authority, guiding the AI guild and giving the final approval to proceed to the next phase.

## 🔧 Customization

PolyChronos Ω is a framework, not a cage. You can and should adapt it to your needs.

-   **Personas (`/context/personas/`)**: Modify the capabilities or add new roles to the guild.
-   **Rules (`.cursorrules`)**: Adjust code length limits, required approvers, test coverage thresholds, and more.
-   **Templates (`/docs/living/`)**: Add or remove sections from the planning documents to better suit your project's domain.
