# PolyChronos Œ© v5.0 ‚Äì Project FrameworknnWelcome to the **PolyChronos Œ© v5.0** project scaffold. This repository provides everything you need to plan, design, build and deliver enterprise‚Äëgrade software using Cursor IDE. The framework is persona‚Äëdriven, phase‚Äëaware and context‚Äëfirst. Before you begin coding, please complete the planning templates and load them into Cursor.nn## Getting Startednn1. **Clone this repository** into your Cursor workspace.n2. **Read through the personas** in `/context/personas/` to understand each role's capabilities. The Project Manager (PM) is the default persona and will coordinate subsequent phases.n3. **Fill out the planning templates** in `/docs/living/` in the following order:n   - `Discovery.md`n   - `PRD.md`n   - `Architecture.md`n   - `TestPlan.md`n   - `LoggingStrategy.md`n   - `CodeReviewChecklist.md`n   - `RefactoringPlan.md` (optional for existing codebases)n   - `DecisionLog.md` (ongoing)n4. **Update `.cursorrules`** if you need to adjust defaults (e.g., change default persona, update quality thresholds).n5. **Set `PolyChronos-Omega.md` as your system prompt** in Cursor. The PM will ask clarifying questions based on your completed templates and begin orchestrating the build.n6. **Follow the phase prompts** in `/prompts/core/` as directed by the PM. Each phase must pass its quality gates before moving on. Use the `üëç Proceed` mechanism to advance.nn## Template UsagennEach template includes a **"Required Inputs"** section. These fields **must be completed** before the PM initiates the project. The better your inputs, the more effective the AI‚Äëdriven planning will be. If a field is unknown, describe your assumptions or flag it for research.nnAfter you complete a template, commit it to your repository so the PM can reference it via `@file`. The PM will then tailor the subsequent phases based on the depth of your planning. Incomplete templates may trigger additional discovery or research steps.nn## PromptsnnPrompts in `/prompts/core/` provide phase‚Äëspecific instructions for the PolyChronos personas. These are not meant to be run directly by you; rather, they are used by the system prompt to structure its responses. You can read them to understand what each phase entails.nn## PersonasnnPersona profiles are stored under `/context/personas/`. Each file describes the role's charter, qualifications and readiness checklist. You can customise these profiles, but it's recommended to maintain the high standards defined here.nn## .cursorrulesnnThe `.cursorrules` file defines project rules such as the default persona per phase, code quality standards, context limits, quality gates and workflow controls. Adjust these settings to suit your project, but maintain strict quality thresholds to ensure enterprise‚Äëgrade outputs.nn## QuestionsnnIf the PM or any persona requests clarification during the process, provide succinct, factual answers and update the relevant template. The system uses your answers to refine its context and produce better results.n
