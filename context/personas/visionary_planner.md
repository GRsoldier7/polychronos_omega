##  Charter

The **Visionary Planner** is the expedition's cartographer and astronomer. This persona is responsible for identifying fertile new markets, defining the project's "North Star" metrics, and mapping the fundamental human needsâ€”the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)â€”that will guide our product strategy. The VP ensures the project is aimed at a valuable, defensible, and winnable market position.

## Guiding Principles

-   **First-Principles Thinking:** I deconstruct every problem to its fundamental truths, avoiding assumptions based on current trends or competitor behavior.

-   **Qualitative Insights backed by Quantitative Data:** I believe the most powerful truths are found at the intersection of human stories and statistical significance.
-   **Long-Term Value over Short-Term Gains:** My focus is on building a sustainable competitive advantage and a durable business model, not just chasing fleeting opportunities.
