Of course. Here is a professionally formatted and significantly enhanced version of your Product Requirements Document (PRD).

This new template elevates the original checklist into a comprehensive, industry-standard PRD. It provides a clear narrative structure, detailed tables for requirements and metrics, and dedicated sections for critical elements like non-functional requirements, scope boundaries, and risk assessment. This format is designed to align all stakeholders and provide an unambiguous source of truth for the entire product development lifecycle.

## 1. Overview & Strategic Alignment

### 1.1. Executive Summary
[Provide a concise, high-level summary of the project. What are we building, for whom, and why? This should be a 2-3 sentence elevator pitch that anyone in the company can understand.]

### 1.2. Business Objectives & Goals
This project supports the following company-level objectives (OKRs):
-   **Objective 1:** [e.g., Increase user engagement by 15% in Q4.]
-   **Objective 2:** [e.g., Expand into the mid-market customer segment.]
-   **Business Goal:** [e.g., The goal of this feature is to reduce customer churn by improving the user's ability to self-serve, directly impacting our goal of increasing monthly recurring revenue (MRR).]

## 2. The Problem

### 2.1. Problem Statement
[Clearly and concisely describe the customer pain point or business problem this product will solve. What fundamental issue are users facing?]

*Example: "Our users, primarily small business owners, struggle to reconcile their monthly sales data with their accounting software, a manual process that takes them an average of 5 hours per month and is prone to costly errors."*

### 2.2. Target User Personas
This feature is targeted at the following user segments:

| Persona Name | Description                                                               | Key Goals & Frustrations                                                                 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[e.g., "Sam the SMB Owner"]** | Owns a small e-commerce business with 5-10 employees. Is tech-savvy but time-poor. | **Goal:** Automate repetitive financial tasks. <br/> **Frustration:** Wastes too much time on manual data entry. |
| **[Persona 2]** | [Brief description of the user archetype.]                                    | **Goal:** [User's primary objective.] <br/> **Frustration:** [Key pain point.] |

### 2.3. Current Solutions & Gaps
[Analyze how users are currently solving this problem (e.g., using competitor products, spreadsheets, manual workarounds). What are the deficiencies in these existing solutions that create an opportunity for us?]

---

## 3. The Proposed Solution

### 3.1. Solution Overview
[Describe your proposed solution at a high level. How does it address the problem statement? Outline the core user experience and the value proposition.]

*Example: "We will build a one-click integration module that allows users to securely connect their accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) to our platform. Once connected, sales data will be automatically synced daily, eliminating the need for manual CSV exports and imports."*

### 3.2. Key Features
-   **Feature 1:** [e.g., Secure OAuth2 connection to QuickBooks and Xero.]
-   **Feature 2:** [e.g., Automated daily synchronization of sales and transaction data.]
-   **Feature 3:** [e.g., User dashboard showing sync history, status, and error logs.]
-   **Feature 4:** [e.g., Manual "Sync Now" button for on-demand updates.]

## 4. User Stories & Requirements

### 4.1. User Stories

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US-01** | As a Small Business Owner, I want to securely connect my QuickBooks account so that my sales data can be synced automatically. | - User can initiate connection from the "Integrations" page.<br/>- User is redirected to a secure QuickBooks OAuth flow.<br/>- Upon successful authorization, the connection status is shown as "Active." | P0 |
| **US-02** | As a Small Business Owner, I want to see a history of my data syncs so that I can verify the process is working correctly. | - Dashboard displays a list of the last 10 syncs.<br/>- Each entry shows date, time, status (Success/Failed), and records synced.<br/>- Failed syncs provide a user-friendly error message. | P0 |
| **US-03** | As an Admin, I want to be able to disable the integration for a specific user account in case of an issue. | - Admin panel has a feature to revoke the OAuth token for any user.<br/>- Disabling the connection stops all future syncs. | P1 |
| **US-04** | ... | ... | P2 |

### 4.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:** The data sync process must not negatively impact the performance of the main application. P0 syncs must complete within 5 minutes.
-   **Security:** All authentication tokens and user credentials must be stored encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
-   **Accessibility:** The user interface for the integration dashboard must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.
-   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle data syncs for up to 10,000 concurrent users.

### 4.3. Out of Scope
-   Integration with any accounting software other than QuickBooks and Xero.
-   Two-way data sync (data will only flow from our platform to the accounting software).
-   Historical data import for sales data older than 90 days.
