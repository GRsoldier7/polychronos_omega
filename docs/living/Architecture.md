## 1. Overview & Goals

### 1.1. Executive Summary
This document details the architecture for the **[Project/System Name]**. It describes the system's components, their interactions, the technologies used, and the reasoning behind key architectural decisions. This document serves as the technical blueprint for the development team and ensures alignment with business objectives outlined in the [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./PRD.md).

### 1.2. Architectural Goals & Drivers
The architecture is designed to meet the following primary goals and principles:
-   **Scalability:** [e.g., Handle a 10x increase in user traffic over the next 2 years with horizontal scaling.]
-   **Reliability:** [e.g., Achieve 99.95% uptime through redundancy and fault-tolerant design.]
-   **Maintainability:** [e.g., Enable small, independent teams to deploy features with minimal dependencies.]
-   **Security:** [e.g., Comply with SOC 2 standards by isolating services and enforcing a zero-trust security model.]
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** [e.g., Utilize serverless components and managed services to minimize idle infrastructure costs and operational overhead.]

## 2. System Architecture & Diagrams

### 2.1. System Context Diagram (C4 Model: Level 1)
This diagram shows the system as a black box, illustrating its relationship with users and other external systems.

`[Insert a high-level context diagram here. Tools like diagrams.net, Miro, or PlantUML are recommended.]`

*Example: A diagram showing users accessing a Web App, which communicates with our API, which in turn interacts with third-party services like Stripe and a primary database.*

### 2.2. Container Diagram (C4 Model: Level 2)
This diagram zooms into the system, showing the high-level technical containers (applications, data stores, services) and their interactions.

`[Insert a more detailed container/component diagram here.]`

*Example: A diagram showing a Load Balancer, a React Frontend (running in a browser), an Authentication Service, a User Profile Service, an Orders Service (all as separate containers), and a PostgreSQL Database, with arrows indicating the communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS/REST, gRPC).*

## 3. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale & Key Considerations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | `[e.g., React with Next.js]` | `[e.g., Rich ecosystem, server-side rendering for SEO, strong team expertise.]` |
| **Backend API** | `[e.g., Go with Gin framework]` | `[e.g., High performance for I/O-bound tasks, strong typing, excellent concurrency support.]` |
| **Database** | `[e.g., PostgreSQL (managed via AWS RDS)]` | `[e.g., ACID compliance, powerful querying, JSONB support for flexibility, and managed service for reliability.]` |
| **Infrastructure** | `[e.g., AWS, Docker, Terraform]` | `[e.g., Services deployed as Docker containers on ECS Fargate. Infrastructure managed via Terraform for reproducibility.]` |
| **Observability** | `[e.g., OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana]` | `[e.g., Open-source standard for logs, metrics, and traces. Cost-effective and highly customizable.]` |

## 4. Key Architectural Patterns

### 4.1. System Pattern
The system will be built using a **Microservices Architecture**.
-   **Rationale:** This pattern was chosen to support our goals of maintainability and scalability. It allows for independent team deployments, technology diversity per service, and granular scaling of components based on demand. This aligns with our organizational structure and long-term growth plans.

### 4.2. Integration & Communication Patterns
-   **Synchronous Communication:** For user-facing requests requiring an immediate response, services will communicate via **REST APIs**. This is a well-understood, stateless pattern that is easy to implement and secure.
-   **Asynchronous Communication:** For background tasks, inter-service notifications, and long-running processes, we will use a **Message Queue (AWS SQS)**. This decouples services, improves fault tolerance by handling backpressure, and ensures durability of tasks.

## 5. Data Model & Management

-   **High-Level Data Schema:** `[Insert an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) or a high-level description of the core data models.]`
-   **Data Flow:** `[Describe how data flows through the system. Where is data created, read, updated, and deleted (CRUD)? How is data consistency maintained between services, e.g., using the Saga pattern for distributed transactions?]`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) Strategy

This section details *how* the architecture will achieve the key quality attributes.

-   **Scalability:** Services are designed to be stateless and will be deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, allowing for horizontal scaling by increasing the container count. The database will be a managed AWS RDS instance that can be scaled vertically as needed.
-   **Security:** All inter-service communication will be secured within a VPC. User authentication will be handled by a dedicated service using JWTs. All sensitive data will be encrypted at rest (using AWS KMS) and in transit (using TLS 1.3).
-   **Performance:** A Redis cache will be implemented to reduce database load for frequently accessed, read-heavy data. A CDN (AWS CloudFront) will serve static assets to reduce latency for global users.
-   **Reliability & Disaster Recovery:** The application will be deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. Database backups will be taken daily, with point-in-time recovery enabled. Infrastructure is defined as code (Terraform) for rapid redeployment in case of a regional failure.

## 7. Architectural Decisions & Trade-offs Log

| Decision | Trade-offs Considered | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chose REST over GraphQL for internal APIs** | GraphQL offers flexible client queries. | REST is simpler to implement, cache, and secure for service-to-service communication where query flexibility is not a primary concern. |
| **Use Managed Services (e.g., RDS, SQS) over self-hosting** | Self-hosting can be cheaper at extreme scale. | Managed services significantly reduce operational overhead, allowing the team to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure maintenance. |
