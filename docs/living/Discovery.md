## 1. Executive Summary & Recommendation

### 1.1. The Opportunity
[Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the core business opportunity or user problem identified during the discovery phase.]

*Example: "Our market research and user interviews reveal a significant opportunity to capture the mid-market segment by addressing their unmet need for automated, compliant financial reportingâ€”a process they currently manage with error-prone spreadsheets, costing them an estimated 20 hours per month."*

### 1.2. The Proposed Solution
[Briefly describe the proposed product or feature concept at a high level. What are you proposing to build?]

*Example: "We propose developing a new 'Compliance Dashboard' module that integrates directly with our existing platform, offering one-click report generation for key regulatory frameworks."*

### 1.3. Recommendation
**[State your recommendation clearly. e.g., "Proceed with funding and staffing", "Conduct further research", or "Do not proceed".]**

*Example: "We recommend proceeding with a 6-week product design and prototyping phase, followed by a phased engineering plan, to capitalize on this opportunity before competitors enter the space."*

## 3. User & Customer Insights

### 3.1. Target User Personas

| Persona Name | Role & Demographics | Key Goals | Pain Points & Frustrations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[e.g., "Compliance Carol"]** | Compliance Manager at a mid-sized tech firm. 35-45 years old. | Ensure the company meets all regulatory requirements without slowing down development. | - Wasting time chasing engineers for data.<br/>- Manual, repetitive report building.<br/>- Fear of missing a critical compliance update. |

### 3.2. User Journey & Pain Points
[Map the current user journey for the problem area. Highlight the key steps where users experience friction, frustration, or inefficiency. This is where your solution will provide the most value.]

> **Key Insight:** [Summarize the single most important finding from your user research in a powerful, quotable sentence. e.g., "Users don't want more features; they want more time. Our solution gives them time back."]

## 4. Proposed Solution & Scope

### 4.1. High-Level Solution Concept
[Expand on the solution from the executive summary. Describe the key user flows and how the solution directly addresses the pain points identified in the user research.]

### 4.2. Proposed Features & Scope

#### In-Scope
-   [Feature 1: e.g., Dashboard view of compliance status.]
-   [Feature 2: e.g., Automated data collection from connected systems.]
-   [Feature 3: e.g., One-click PDF export for SOC 2 reports.]

#### Out-of-Scope
-   [e.g., Support for compliance frameworks other than SOC 2 and GDPR in V1.]
-   [e.g., Real-time alerting functionality.]
-   [e.g., A mobile application.]

## 5. Technical Feasibility Assessment

-   **Proposed Technology Stack:** [Summarize the recommended tech stack and why it's a good fit. Can we leverage existing technologies?]
-   **Key Architectural Considerations:** [Note any major architectural decisions or patterns, e.g., "This will be built as a new microservice to ensure separation of concerns."]
-   **Dependencies & Integration Points:** [List any dependencies on existing internal systems or third-party APIs.]
-   **Proof of Concept (PoC) Findings:** [Summarize the results of any technical spikes or PoCs conducted during discovery.]

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Description | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Mitigation Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical** | [e.g., A key third-party API is unreliable.] | Medium | [e.g., Build a resilient integration with retry logic and circuit breakers.] |
| **Market** | [e.g., A major competitor launches a similar feature first.] | High | [e.g., Focus on a phased, rapid release to establish a first-mover advantage.] |
