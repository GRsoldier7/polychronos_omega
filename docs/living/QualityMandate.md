## 1. The PolyChronos Quality Mandate

This document establishes the non-negotiable standard of quality for all work conducted within the PolyChronos framework. It serves as the guiding principle for all personas and supersedes any process that might compromise its integrity.

The Mandate is as follows:

> **It is to be clearly and distinctly understood that in order to be considered "Done," every requirement, enhancement, feature, or change of any kind MUST be properly Planned, Developed, Implemented, AND Verified through rigorous testing. This cycle must be completed every time. There are no exceptions.**

## 2. Definition of Done (DoD)

To ensure adherence to the Mandate, the following "Definition of Done" applies at all levels of work. No task, story, or feature may pass its phase gate without meeting these criteria.

### 2.1. DoD for a User Story

A User Story is considered **Done** only when:
-   [ ] All functional requirements outlined in the story's Acceptance Criteria have been met.
-   [ ] The code has been written and implemented according to the standards championed by the **Lead Engineer**.
-   [ ] The code is covered by new or updated unit and integration tests, as validated by the **QA Director**.
-   [ ] The code has passed all automated CI checks, including linting and security scans overseen by **The Sentinel**.
-   [ ] The implementation has been peer-reviewed and approved by at least one other engineer.
-   [ ] Any related documentation (code comments, diagrams) has been updated to the standard of **The Loremaster**.
-   [ ] The feature has been successfully deployed to a staging environment.

### 2.2. DoD for a Feature (Epic)

A Feature (a collection of User Stories) is considered **Done** only when:
-   [ ] All constituent User Stories are **Done**.
-   [ ] The feature has been tested end-to-end, as defined in the `TestPlan.md`.
-   [ ] The feature meets all relevant Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Scalability, Security) as defined in the `Architecture.md`.
-   [ ] The user-facing documentation (if any) has been drafted and reviewed.
-   [ ] A successful demonstration of the feature has been provided to the **Product Strategist** and key stakeholders.

### 2.3. DoD for a Release

A product version is considered **Ready for Release** only when:
-   [ ] All features planned for the release are **Done**.
-   [ ] A full regression testing cycle has been completed and passed.
-   [ ] All P0 (Blocker) and P1 (Critical) bugs have been resolved.
-   [ ] The final release plan has been approved by the **Project Manager** and **DevOps Lead**.
-   [ ] All relevant documentation in the project's "Living Canon" is up-to-date.

This document is the ultimate authority on quality. It is the responsibility of the **Project Manager** and every persona in the guild to uphold these standards without compromise.
