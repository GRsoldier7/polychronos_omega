## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1. Test Levels

| Test Level            | Description                                                                                             | Owner(s)           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Unit Testing** | Granular tests for individual functions, methods, or components to ensure they behave as expected.      | Developer          |
| **Integration Testing** | Testing the interfaces and interactions between integrated components or microservices.               | Developer / SDET   |
| **System Testing** | End-to-end testing of the complete, integrated system to evaluate its compliance with specified requirements. | QA Director / SDET |
| **User Acceptance (UAT)** | Formal testing conducted to determine whether the system satisfies its acceptance criteria.          | Product / Stakeholder |

### 4.2. Test Types

-   **Functional Testing**: Verifying that the application's features work according to the specified requirements and user stories.
-   **Performance Testing**: Evaluating system performance under load, including stress, soak, and spike testing to ensure stability and responsiveness.
-   **Security Testing**: Identifying vulnerabilities through SAST, DAST, and manual penetration testing to ensure data integrity and system security.
-   **UI/UX & Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring the user interface is intuitive, meets design standards, and complies with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
-   **Compatibility Testing**: Verifying the application functions correctly across specified browsers, devices, and operating systems.

## 5. Test Coverage & Quality Metrics

The following coverage targets are established as key indicators of quality.

| Test Level        | Target Coverage | Measurement Tool(s)                |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unit Test         | 90%+            | `[e.g., Jest, Cobertura, SonarQube]` |
| Integration Test  | 80%+            | `[e.g., Postman, Cypress]`         |
| System Test       | 95%             | `[Manual, based on requirements]`  |
| Performance Test  | 100% (of critical user journeys) | `[e.g., k6, JMeter]`               |
| Security Test     | 100% (of OWASP Top 10 checks)    | `[e.g., Snyk, OWASP ZAP]`          |
