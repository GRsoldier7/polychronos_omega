**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Author/Owner:** [Your Name / Tech Lead / Refactoring Champion]

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategic plan for refactoring the **[Feature / Module / System Name]**. The primary goal is to address identified technical debt, improve code quality, and enhance non-functional requirements such as performance, security, and maintainability. This plan details the scope, approach, risks, and success criteria for the refactoring effort.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

The successful completion of this refactoring initiative will achieve the following measurable outcomes:

-   **Performance:** [e.g., Reduce average API response time for endpoint X by 20%]
-   **Maintainability:** [e.g., Improve the static analysis score for the `billing` module from C to A]
-   **Security:** [e.g., Remediate all critical and high-severity vulnerabilities identified in the latest Snyk scan]
-   **Scalability:** [e.g., Enable the user authentication service to handle 50% more concurrent requests]
-   **Testability:** [e.g., Increase unit test coverage in the `core` library from 65% to 85%]
-   **Onboarding:** [e.g., Reduce the time for a new developer to complete their first task in this module by 30%]

## 3. Prerequisite Inputs & Analysis

This plan is based on the following assessments and reports. All linked artifacts should be reviewed before proceeding.

| Input / Report                       | Status (Not Started / In Progress / Complete) | Link/Reference                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| Technical Debt Register              | `[Status]`                                    | `[Link to Jira/Notion page or this document's table]` |
| Performance Bottleneck Analysis      | `[Status]`                                    | `[Link to APM data, e.g., Dynatrace, New Relic]`    |
| Security Vulnerability Scan          | `[Status]`                                    | `[Link to Snyk/Veracode/Checkmarx report]`          |
| System Architecture Diagrams         | `[Status]`                                    | `[Link to Architecture.md or diagram]`            |
| Resource & Budget Constraints        | `[Status]`                                    | `[Link to Project Plan or Stakeholder email]`     |

## 4. Technical Debt Register & Refactoring Scope

### 4.1. In-Scope Items

The following items have been prioritized for this refactoring cycle.

| ID   | Description of Debt                               | Location(s) in Codebase       | Impact (Perf/Sec/Maint) | Priority | Proposed Action                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RF-01** | N+1 query problem in `getUserProfile` service.    | `services/user.js`            | Performance             | P0       | Implement DataLoader pattern to batch database queries.   |
| **RF-02** | Outdated dependency (`left-pad v1.2`) with known security flaw. | `package.json`                | Security                | P0       | Update to latest version and run regression tests.      |
| **RF-03** | Large, monolithic `PaymentController` class (1000+ lines). | `controllers/payment.ts`      | Maintainability       | P1       | Decompose into smaller, single-responsibility services. |
| **RF-04** | Lack of unit tests for critical business logic.   | `lib/calculation.py`          | Maintainability / Risk  | P1       | Add unit tests to achieve 90% line coverage.            |
| **RF-05** | Inconsistent logging format across services.      | `services/*`                  | Observability           | P2       | Implement structured JSON logging globally.             |

### 4.2. Out-of-Scope Items
-   **UI/Frontend Rewrite**: This refactoring focuses solely on the backend services.
-   **Database Migration**: The current database schema will not be altered.
-   **Full rewrite of the Legacy Module X**: Only critical security patches will be applied.

---

## 5. Refactoring Strategy & Execution Plan

### 5.1. Approach
We will adopt an **incremental, branch-by-abstraction** approach. Each refactoring item (or a small group of related items) will be addressed in a separate, short-lived feature branch. This minimizes risk and avoids a "big bang" integration. Each change will be covered by new or existing tests before being merged.

### 5.2. Testing Strategy
-   **Pre-Refactoring**: A baseline of integration and end-to-end tests will be run to confirm current system behavior.
-   **During Refactoring**: For every code change, corresponding unit tests must be added or updated. The goal is to not decrease the existing test coverage.
-   **Post-Refactoring**: The full regression suite (unit, integration, and E2E) will be executed on the feature branch before merging. A performance benchmark will be run to validate improvements.

### 5.3. Rollback & Recovery Plan
-   All changes will be managed via feature flags where applicable.
-   In case of a critical issue post-deployment, the merge commit for the refactoring will be reverted.
-   Database changes (if any, though out-of-scope for now) would require a pre-written rollback script.

### 5.4. Stakeholder Communication
-   A weekly update will be shared in the `#engineering` Slack channel.
-   A final demonstration will be scheduled with Product and QA teams upon completion.

## 6. Risk Assessment

| Risk Description                                    | Likelihood (Low/Med/High) | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Mitigation Plan                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Introduction of new bugs (regressions)** | Medium                    | High                  | Comprehensive automated testing; peer review by a senior engineer.              |
| **Unforeseen technical complexity causes delays** | Medium                    | Medium                | Time-box initial investigation (spikes); be prepared to de-scope P2 items.    |
| **Performance degradation in a related component** | Low                       | High                  | Run performance benchmarks in a staging environment before merging to main. |
