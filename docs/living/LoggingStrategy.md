## 1\. Overview & Goals

### 1.1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for logging, monitoring, metrics, and tracing for the **[Project/System Name]**. The goal is to establish a robust observability framework that enables developers and operators to proactively monitor system health, rapidly diagnose and resolve issues, and make data-driven decisions about performance and scalability.

### 1.2. Business & Operational Objectives
This strategy directly supports the following key objectives:
-   **Availability:** Achieve and maintain a **99.95% uptime** Service Level Objective (SLO).
-   **Performance:** Ensure key user transactions have a **p95 latency of under 500ms**.
-   **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Reduce the average time to resolve P0/P1 incidents by **30%**.
-   **Security & Compliance:** Ensure all access and sensitive operations are logged to meet **[e.g., SOC 2, GDPR]** compliance requirements.

## 2\. The Three Pillars of Observability

Our strategy is built upon the three foundational pillars of observability: Logs, Metrics, and Traces.

### 2.1. Pillar 1: Structured Logging

Logs are detailed, timestamped records of discrete events. All logs **must** be emitted in a structured **JSON format** to enable efficient parsing, searching, and analysis.

#### Log Levels
| Level | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ERROR** | Unrecoverable errors, application crashes, or failures requiring immediate attention. | `Database connection failed`, `Uncaught exception` |
| **WARN** | Potentially harmful situations or non-critical errors that should be monitored. | `API rate limit approaching`, `Deprecated method called` |
| **INFO** | High-level, routine information confirming the application is operating as expected. | `Service started on port 8080`, `User successfully authenticated` |
| **DEBUG** | Detailed diagnostic information useful for debugging during development. | `Payload received from API`, `Variable state in a function` |

> **Note:** `DEBUG` level logs should be disabled by default in production environments but can be enabled dynamically for troubleshooting.

#### Standard Log Schema
All log entries should adhere to a consistent schema.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T19:46:51Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service.name": "user-authentication-service",
  "service.version": "1.2.3",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "correlation_id": "abc-123-xyz-789",
  "trace_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "user.id": "usr_aBCdEFg",
  "http.method": "POST",
  "http.path": "/api/v1/login",
  "duration_ms": 152,
  "error.message": null,
  "error.stack": null
}

### 2.3. Pillar 3: Distributed Tracing

Traces provide a complete view of a request's journey as it propagates through multiple microservices. This is essential for debugging latency and understanding complex workflows.

  - **Standard:** All services **must** implement **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** for trace propagation.
  - **Correlation:** The `trace_id` and `correlation_id` must be present in all logs and metrics associated with a given request.

## 3\. Tooling & Infrastructure

| Category | Tool Selection | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log Aggregation** | `[e.g., Datadog, Splunk, ELK Stack]` | `[Reason for choosing this tool]` |
| **Metrics & Monitoring** | `[e.g., Prometheus & Grafana, Datadog]` | `[Reason for choosing this tool]` |
| **Tracing** | `[e.g., Jaeger, Datadog APM, Honeycomb]` | `[Reason for choosing this tool]` |
| **Alerting** | `[e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie]` | `[Reason for choosing this tool]` |

-----

## 4\. Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

Alerts will be prioritized to minimize noise and focus on actionable, symptom-based issues.

| Severity | Description | Target Response Time | Notification Channel(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0 (Critical)** | System-wide outage or critical impact on users. | **\< 5 minutes** | PagerDuty + dedicated Slack channel |
| **P1 (High)** | Major feature failure or significant user impact. | **\< 15 minutes** | PagerDuty + dedicated Slack channel |
| **P2 (Warning)** | A non-critical SLO is at risk; potential for future impact. | **\< 1 hour** | Slack channel |
| **P3 (Info)** | Low-priority, non-urgent issue. | **\< 24 hours** | Ticket created in Jira/Linear |

-----

## 5\. Data Management & Compliance

  - **Log Retention:**
      - **Production:** Logs will be searchable in `[Tool Name]` for **30 days** and archived in cold storage for **1 year** for compliance.
      - **Staging/Dev:** Logs will be retained for **7 days**.
  - **Cost Management:** `DEBUG` logs will be heavily sampled in production to control ingestion costs.
  - **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** No sensitive PII (e.g., passwords, API keys, credit card numbers) should ever be logged in plain text. All logging must adhere to the PII Masking Policy.

-----

## 6\. Implementation Quality Gates

  - [ ] This observability plan has been reviewed and approved by all key stakeholders.
  - [ ] A standard logging library has been configured and distributed for all services.
  - [ ] The selected observability tools have been provisioned and configured.
  - [ ] Key dashboards for service health and business KPIs have been created.
  - [ ] Alerting rules and on-call rotations have been established.
  - [ ] A "logging and metrics" section has been added to the pull request template to ensure new features include proper instrumentation.
