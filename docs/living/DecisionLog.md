### <a id="dec-001"></a>DEC-001: Adopt PostgreSQL over MongoDB

-   **Status:** **Accepted**
-   **Date:** 2025-08-31
-   **Owner:** [Lead Engineer]

#### Context
The project requires a primary database to store user, product, and transaction data. The core domain involves highly relational data (users have orders, orders have line items, etc.), and data integrity is a critical business requirement. We needed to choose a database technology that could support our initial launch and scale with future growth.

#### Alternatives Considered
1.  **MongoDB (NoSQL):** Considered for its flexible schema, scalability, and developer-friendliness, which would allow for rapid initial development.
2.  **MySQL (SQL):** Another strong relational database contender, widely used and well-supported.
3.  **PostgreSQL (SQL):** A powerful, open-source object-relational database known for its reliability, feature robustness, and extensibility.

#### Rationale for Decision
We selected **PostgreSQL** for the following reasons:
-   **Data Integrity:** The project's relational nature makes ACID compliance and strong transactional support paramount. PostgreSQL excels in this area.
-   **Rich Feature Set:** It supports advanced data types (like JSONB for semi-structured data), powerful indexing, and full-text search, offering a good balance of structure and flexibility.
-   **Proven Scalability:** While NoSQL databases are often touted for scalability, PostgreSQL has a proven track record of scaling to handle very large workloads.
-   **Future-Proofing:** Its extensibility allows us to adapt as our needs evolve, preventing a premature need to migrate or add another database technology.

#### Impact
-   **Positive:** Enforces a structured schema from the beginning, reducing the risk of data consistency issues down the line. Aligns with the team's existing expertise in SQL.
-   **Negative:** Requires more upfront schema design compared to MongoDB, which may slightly slow down initial feature development.
-   **Follow-up Actions:** The DevOps team will provision a managed PostgreSQL instance (e.g., AWS RDS). The engineering team will finalize the V1 schema.
